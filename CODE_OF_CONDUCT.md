# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a friendly, inclusive, and respectful environment for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces (e.g., social media or conferences).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at:

ðŸ“§ **[your-email@example.com]** *(replace this with your actual email or GitHub contact method)*

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
